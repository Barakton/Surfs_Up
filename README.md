# Surfs_Up
## Overview
I was asked to provide temperature data for the island Oahu in the months June and December. The primary purpose of this data is to determine if running a surf and ice cream shop can thrive year-round.
## Results
![June](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83259639/124371779-ba868200-dc4a-11eb-80cc-0036ad9d1edc.PNG)

There are a few key points we can take away while looking at our DataFrames.
- December has a lower average than June, meaning there are more outliers(i.e. hotter days occur less in December).
- Junes lowest temperature 8 degrees higher than Decembers.
- On average, June and December have 75 and 71 degrees respectively.
## Summary
In conclusion, I would recommend two additional queries.
- Collect more than a year of weather data to get a better picture of the weather in those two months.
- Collect information on raid data. Find out how much it rains/snows in those two months.
